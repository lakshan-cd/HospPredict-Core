## Usage

### 1. Training the Enhanced Ensemble Model

```python
from src.news.train_enhanced_ensemble import main

# Run the training pipeline
main()
```

The training script will:
- Load and preprocess your data
- Create advanced features
- Train individual models
- Build the ensemble
- Save all models

### 2. Making Predictions

```python
from src.news.predict_with_ensemble import NewsPredictor

# Initialize predictor
predictor = NewsPredictor()

# Make prediction for a single article
prediction = predictor.predict_single_article(
    heading="John Keells Hotels Reports Strong Q3 Performance",
    content="John Keells Hotels PLC announced impressive third-quarter results...",
    source="economynext"
)

print(f"Spike Probability: {prediction['spike_probability']:.3f}")
print(f"Ensemble Probability: {prediction['ensemble_probability']:.3f}")
```

### 3. Running Relationship Analysis

```python
from src.news.relationship_analysis_demo import RelationshipAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = RelationshipAnalyzer()

# Run complete analysis
processed_df, analysis_results = analyzer.run_complete_analysis()
```

## Enhanced Preprocessing Techniques

### 1. Temporal Alignment
- **Multi-window Analysis**: Analyzes relationships across different time windows (1, 3, 7, 14 days)
- **Lag Analysis**: Examines lead-lag relationships between news, search, and stock movements
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Accounts for seasonal patterns in tourism and stock markets

### 2. Advanced Spike Detection
- **Statistical Methods**: Z-score based spike detection with rolling statistics
- **Volatility-based Detection**: Identifies spikes based on volatility changes
- **Multi-timeframe Analysis**: Combines signals from different time windows
- **Change Point Detection**: Identifies structural breaks in the data

### 3. Causality Analysis
- **Granger-like Causality**: Tests whether one variable helps predict another
- **Lead-Lag Analysis**: Examines temporal precedence between variables
- **Cross-correlation Analysis**: Measures correlation at different time lags
- **Information Flow Analysis**: Uses mutual information to measure relationships

### 4. Feature Engineering
- **Interaction Features**: Creates features that capture relationships between modalities
- **Ratio Features**: Calculates ratios between different variables
- **Polynomial Features**: Captures non-linear relationships
- **Rolling Features**: Creates moving average and volatility features
- **Lag Features**: Incorporates historical information

## Model Architecture

### Spike Prediction Model
- **Ensemble of Models**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Network
- **Soft Voting**: Combines predictions using probability scores
- **SMOTE Balancing**: Handles class imbalance in spike detection

### Price Movement Models
- **Hotel-Specific Models**: Individual models for each hotel
- **Multi-class Classification**: Predicts up/down/neutral movements
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjusts thresholds based on hotel volatility

### Final Ensemble Model

config = {
    'temporal_windows': [1, 3, 7, 14],  # Days before/after news
    'spike_threshold': 2.0,  # Standard deviations for spike detection
    'correlation_threshold': 0.3,  # Minimum correlation to consider relationship
    'min_samples': 10,  # Minimum samples for statistical tests
    'rolling_windows': [3, 7, 14, 30],  # Rolling window sizes
    'feature_selection_k': 50,  # Top k features to select
    'causality_lag_max': 7,  # Maximum lag for causality analysis
}

preprocessor = EnhancedNewsPreprocessor(config)
```

- Handle missing values appropriately
- Validate data ranges and remove outliers

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Start with basic features and gradually add complexity
- Monitor feature importance to avoid overfitting
- Use cross-validation to validate feature selection

### 3. Model Training
- Use stratified sampling for imbalanced datasets
- Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Monitor validation metrics during training

### 4. Evaluation
