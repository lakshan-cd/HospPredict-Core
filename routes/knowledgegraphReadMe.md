Great question! Your knowledge graph, as defined by your `schema.py`, `loader.py`, and `dynamic.py`, is a **rich, temporal, multi-relational graph** of companies, financial metrics, stock metrics, and time periods. This enables a wide range of advanced analytics and interactive features for your users in the frontend (FE).

Below are **practical, valuable things you can offer to users** using your knowledge graph, along with ideas for API endpoints and frontend visualizations:

---

## 1. **Company Financial & Stock Metric Timelines**
- **What:** Show time series of any financial or stock metric for a company (e.g., Revenue, NetIncome, volatility, trade volume).
- **How:** Query the graph for all `FinancialMetric` or `StockMetric` nodes for a company, ordered by period/date.
- **FE:** Line charts, area charts, or multi-metric overlays.

---

## 2. **Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ) Change Analysis**
- **What:** Visualize and analyze how key metrics change from one quarter to the next.
- **How:** Use the `QoQ_CHANGE` relationships seeded in `dynamic.py` to get percentage changes for each metric.
- **FE:** Waterfall charts, bar charts, or tables showing % change per quarter.

---

## 3. **Critical Periods & Anomaly Highlighting**
- **What:** Highlight quarters or days that are "critical" (e.g., flagged for high volatility or special events).
- **How:** Use `CRITICAL_PERIOD` and `CRITICAL_DAY` relationships.
- **FE:** Markers on time series, alerts, or summary tables.

---

## 4. **Volatility Aggregation & Risk Trends**
- **What:** Show how volatility (risk) evolves over time, both daily and aggregated quarterly.
- **How:** Use `HAS_VOLATILITY` relationships and `IndicatorSummary` nodes.
- **FE:** Risk trend lines, heatmaps, or volatility distribution plots.

---

## 5. **Company Comparison & Benchmarking**
- **What:** Compare metrics or risk between companies for the same period.
- **How:** Query multiple companies’ metrics for a given period from the graph.
- **FE:** Comparison bar charts, radar/spider charts, or ranking tables.

---

## 6. **Graph Exploration & Relationship Visualization**
- **What:** Let users visually explore the graph structure: how companies, metrics, and periods are connected.
- **How:** Expose graph structure via API (e.g., Neo4j’s `MATCH` queries).
- **FE:** Interactive network/graph visualizations (e.g., force-directed graphs).

---

## 7. **Event/Pattern Detection**
- **What:** Detect and display patterns such as consecutive critical periods, sudden metric jumps, or clusters of high volatility.
- **How:** Traverse the graph for sequences of `CRITICAL_PERIOD` or large `QoQ_CHANGE` edges.
- **FE:** Pattern highlights, event timelines, or summary dashboards.

---

## 8. **Explainability & Causal Tracing**
- **What:** Show users why a certain risk prediction is high/low by tracing back through the graph (e.g., “this quarter is risky because of high volatility and low revenue”).
- **How:** Use graph traversal to find contributing nodes/edges.
- **FE:** Explanation panels, causal graphs, or “why?” tooltips.

---

## 9. **Scenario Simulation**
- **What:** Allow users to simulate changes (e.g., “what if revenue increases by 10%?”) and see the effect on risk or other metrics.
- **How:** Perturb node values and re-run analytics or predictions.
- **FE:** Scenario sliders, input forms, and dynamic result updates.

---

## 10. **Custom Queries & Insights**
- **What:** Let advanced users run custom queries (e.g., “show all periods where NetIncome dropped >20% QoQ”).
- **How:** Expose a query API or predefine useful queries.
- **FE:** Query builder UI, advanced analytics dashboards.

### **API Endpoints You Can Build**
- `/company/{company_id}/metrics/timeline?metric=Revenue`
- `/company/{company_id}/qoq_changes?metric=NetIncome`
- `/company/{company_id}/critical_periods`
- `/company/{company_id}/volatility_trend`
- `/compare?companies=A,B&period=2023Q1&metric=EBITDA`
- `/graph/explore?company_id=...`
- `/company/{company_id}/events/patterns`
- `/company/{company_id}/explain_risk?period=...`
- `/company/{company_id}/simulate?changes={...}`

---

### **Frontend Visualizations**
- Time series charts (line, area)
- Comparison dashboards
- Interactive graph/network views
- Event timelines
- Scenario analysis widgets
- Explainability panels

---

**Summary:**  
Your knowledge graph enables not just data retrieval, but also advanced analytics, pattern detection, explainability, and interactive exploration. This can make your FE much more insightful and actionable for users, investors, or analysts.

If you want, I can help you design specific API endpoints or frontend components for any of these features! Just let me know which ones you want to prioritize.
